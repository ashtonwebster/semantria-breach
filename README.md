semantria-breach
================
A short demonstration of how to use the Semantria API and tweet2csv to calculate sentiment scores for companies.
This demo was meant to illustrate the impact of the breaches on Sony and Staples in December 2014.
For more information please see [the cyberfrontiers article](https://cyberfrontierlabs.com/2014/12/25/analyzing-sony-and-staples-breaches-with-sentiment-analysis/) and [the cyberfrontiers podcast](cyberfrontiers.com/) on the subject.

This is largely based upon the Semantria tutorial and is based upon the Semantria SDK.  Install the SDK like so:
```
pip install semantria_sdk
```
